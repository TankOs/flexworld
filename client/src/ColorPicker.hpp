/** Color picker for picking blocks and entities.
 *
 * The color picker uses color indexing. A ray is shot out along a forward
 * vector with a given distance. All blocks and entities being hit by the ray
 * are added to the scene's geometry and are color-coded. The picker renders
 * the scene in a very small viewport and picks the color of its center. If a
 * block was hit yet another rendering pass will happen that determines which
 * side of the block has been hit (each triangle is color-coded dependant on
 * the normal/facing). If an entity was hit only the proper entity ID is being
 * stored.
